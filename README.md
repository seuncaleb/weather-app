# Weather Dashboard

## Your Task

This week i built a web weather app using HTML, CSS, bootstrap, Jquery and Java Script. In JavaScript I made use of the following to make the project function:

* Objects
* Arrays
* Call back functions
* Regular functions
* If/else statements
* Nested Conditional Statements
* Event Listeners
* local storage 
* Calling APIs


## Lessons Learned 

* How to use local storage function to store data
* How to make use of event listeners
* How to make use query selectors
* How to make use of appendchild function

## Challenges 
 * Function wasn't going through all the questions in my object
 * Moving from one page to another using only JavaScript 
 * Passing items in an Object to the screen using JSON
 * Hiding and unhiding hidden divs
